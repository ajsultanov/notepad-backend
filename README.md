X-Response-Time       - The server-side response time of the request.

**always** check for presence of data before using it

## uh...?
The Forecast Data API supports HTTP compression. We heartily recommend using it, as it will make responses much smaller over the wire. To enable it, simply add an Accept-Encoding: gzip header to your request. (Most HTTP client libraries wrap this functionality for you, please consult your libraryâ€™s documentation for details.)
