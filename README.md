X-Response-Time       - The server-side response time of the request.

**always** check for presence of data before using it

## uh...hm..?
The Forecast Data API supports HTTP compression. We heartily recommend using it, as it will make responses much smaller over the wire. To enable it, simply add an Accept-Encoding: gzip header to your request. (Most HTTP client libraries wrap this functionality for you, please consult your libraryâ€™s documentation for details.)

## GEO

if ("geolocation" in navigator) {
  /* geolocation is available */

  var options = {
    enableHighAccuracy: true,
    timeout: 5000,
    maximumAge: 0
  };

  function success(pos) {
    var crd = pos.coords;

    console.log('Your current position is:');
    console.log(`Latitude : ${crd.latitude}`);
    console.log(`Longitude: ${crd.longitude}`);
    console.log(`More or less ${crd.accuracy} meters.`);
  }

  function error(err) {
    console.warn(`ERROR(${err.code}): ${err.message}`);
  }

  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error, options);

} else {
  /* geolocation IS NOT available */
}

## auth

class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_secure_password
  validates :username, uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }
